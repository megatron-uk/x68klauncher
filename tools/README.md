### tgatool.c

A simple tool, from neko68k on the NFG Forums to convert an 8bit TGA graphic to a pair of PCG and PAL files, suitable for use in loading directly to PCG RAM and Palette RAM.

No external dependencies, build with either `gcc tgatool.c -o tgatool` or via `make` and the included `Makefile`.
