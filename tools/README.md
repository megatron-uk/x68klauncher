### metadata.py

A tool to scrape metadata from Mobygames or from Launchbox, using the output from `launcher.X` when run in 'save' mode.

Place the resulting 'launcher.txt' file in this directory and run metadata.py to download metadata and generate 'launch.dat' and artwork images.

Note: For mobygames, you will need a valid API key.
